<h2>Autonomous car이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car" target="_blank" title="self-driving car specification"></a>
A self-driving car, also known as an <strong><u>autonomous</u> vehicle</strong> (AV),connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV), full self-driving car or driverless car, or robo-car or robotic car,
(automated vehicles and fully automated vehicles in the European Union) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing
its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.
Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive
their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.[1][5]
Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths,
as well as obstacles and relevant signage.</p>

Connected vehicle platoons[5] and long-distance trucking[9] are seen as being at the forefront
of adopting and implementing the technology.</p>
